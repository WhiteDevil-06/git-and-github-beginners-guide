## 🔹 What Are Git & GitHub?

| Tool | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Git** | A version control system that tracks your project’s changes. It runs locally on your machine. |
| **GitHub** | A cloud platform that hosts Git repositories for backup and collaboration. |

Think of it this way:

> **Git = your local engine ⚙️**  
> **GitHub = your online garage ☁️**

---

## ⚙️ 1. Installing & Configuring Git

### 🧩 Install Git
- Download from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Follow default setup (enable “Git from the command line”).

### 🧩 Verify Installation
```bash
git --version
````

### 🧩 Configure User Identity

```bash
git config --global user.name "YourGitHubUsername"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```

### 🧩 Check Configuration

```bash
git config --global --list
```

---

## 🏗️ 2. Creating a New Local Repository

```bash
# Create a folder and navigate inside
mkdir my-project
cd my-project

# Initialize Git tracking
git init
```

> Git will create a hidden `.git` folder — that’s where all version history lives.

## 🧱 3. The Core Git Workflow

| Step   | Command                   | Description                     |
| ------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Stage  | `git add .`               | Prepare files for commit        |
| Commit | `git commit -m "Message"` | Save a snapshot of current work |
| Status | `git status`              | View untracked/changed files    |
| Log    | `git log`                 | View commit history             |

---

## ☁️ 4. Connecting to GitHub (Remote Repository)

1. Create a new **empty** repo on GitHub.
2. Link it locally:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repo-name>.git
   ```
3. Set main branch and push:

   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

✅ Now your code is live on GitHub.

---

## 🌿 5. Understanding Branches

Branches let you work on new features without touching the main code.

### 🧩 Common Commands

```bash
git branch                     # view branches
git checkout -b feature-login  # create + switch to new branch
git checkout main              # go back to main
git branch -d feature-login    # delete branch
```

### 🧾 Naming Conventions

| Type    | Example            |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Feature | `feature-login`    |
| Bug Fix | `bugfix-api-error` |
| Hotfix  | `hotfix-typo`      |

---

## 👥 6. Team Collaboration Flow

### A. Clone Repository (for teammates)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git
cd <repo>
```

### B. Create a Personal Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature-name
```

### C. Work, Commit & Push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your work"
git push -u origin feature-name
```

### D. Create a Pull Request (on GitHub)

1. Go to the repository page.
2. Click **“Compare & Pull Request.”**
3. Set:

   ```
   base: main  ←  compare: feature-name
   ```
4. Add a title & description → **Create Pull Request.**

### E. Review & Merge

* Owner reviews PR and clicks **“Merge Pull Request.”**
* GitHub merges the branch into `main`.

### F. Sync Locally

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

## ⚡ 7. Common Git Errors & Fixes

| Error                                                 | Reason                           | Fix                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `Updates were rejected because remote contains work…` | Remote has commits you don’t     | `git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories` |
| `merge conflict`                                      | Two edits on same lines          | Resolve manually → `git add .` → `git commit`      |
| `git not recognized`                                  | Git not installed or not in PATH | Reinstall Git                                      |
| `master/main mismatch`                                | Old default branch name          | `git branch -M main`                               |
| `nothing to commit`                                   | No file changes                  | You’re up-to-date                                  |

---

## 🧠 8. Merge Conflicts (Quick Example)

When Git can’t decide whose code to keep, you’ll see:

```text
<<<<<<< HEAD
your code
=======
teammate’s code
>>>>>>> feature-ui
```

Fix it manually → remove conflict markers → save → commit again.

---

## 🧩 9. Undo & Reset Commands

| Action                    | Command                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Undo last commit (local)  | `git reset --hard HEAD~1` |
| Undo unstaged file change | `git restore <filename>`  |
| Remove tracked file       | `git rm <filename>`       |
| View diff before commit   | `git diff`                |

---

## 🧭 10. Team Best Practices

✅ Pull before you push → stay updated
✅ Never code directly on main → always branch
✅ Commit small, meaningful changes
✅ Use clear messages (no “update done 😅”)
✅ Delete merged branches → keep repo clean
✅ Review before merging
✅ Always check `git status` before committing

---

## ⚙️ 11. Sample Folder Structure

```
my-project/
│
├── src/                 # core code
├── data/                # data files
├── notebooks/           # experiments
├── tests/               # test scripts
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt
```

## 🔐 12. GitHub Authentication Tips

* Use browser login on first push (HTTPS prompt)
* Or generate a **Personal Access Token** from GitHub → use it instead of password.

Check stored credentials:

```bash
git credential-manager list
```

---

## 🪶 13. Summary Flow (Mental Map)

```
init → add → commit → branch → push → pull → merge → sync → repeat
```

That’s the core Git rhythm — works for every project, every team.

---

## 🌟 14. Key Takeaways

✅ **Git** = version control engine
✅ **GitHub** = collaboration platform
✅ **Branches** = parallel workspaces
✅ **Pull Requests** = code reviews
✅ **Main** = stable, production-ready code
✅ **Merge Conflicts** = normal, fixable part of teamwork
